h1. Wee QR

Wee QR is a really simple QR Code generator on Rack.

h2. Install

Wee QR depends on on the "pngqr":http://rubydoc.info/gems/pngqr/0.5/frames gem, which depends on a couple of other gems -- all pure ruby. Installation on OS X (using bundler) looks something like this:

<pre>
<code>
$ git clone git@github.com:kenkunz/wee-qr
$ cd wee-qr
[review and accept the .rvmrc]
$ bundle install
</code>
</pre>

h2. Usage

Run it with your rack server of choice. Go to the app's url, with the content you want encoded in the _query string_. The response should be QR code png. You can optionally include a _module size_ as a _path parameter_ (default is 5).

For example, I'm running Wee QR at qr.dev, so http://qr.dev/foo returns a QR code that encodes "foo", and http://qr.dev/10?bar%20baz returns a larger QR code (10 pixel modules) that encodes "bar baz".
